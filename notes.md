- Please note that all the basic required routes (crud operations were included on the master branch).
- We could also use the request type (PUT, DELETE, PATCH and others) but i preferred to use the old conventoin instead.
- the todo seeds route, get all (func5) route, and basic authentication route are on the branch func5.
- Please use {username: 'ashraf_Isack', secret: '1234'} on the request body to test the authentication (on func5 branch).
- please find the file postman.collection.sql file to import the postman route collection.
